      <title>My life has been a tight rope</title>
<body>
<p>
      I feel as if I'm teetering <br/>
      High above a dark, black hole,<br/>
      And it's taking everything I have<br/>
      Not to lose control.<br/>
      <br/>
      My feet keep slipping off the tightrope.<br/>
      My arms start flailing in mid-air.<br/>
      I'm sweating 'neath the scorching sun,<br/>
      Blinded by its savage glare.<br/>
      <br/>
      I've been swaying on this tightrope now<br/>
      For more than half my life.<br/>
      But it seems to go on into infinity<br/>
      With no terminus in sight.<br/>
      <br/>
      One shaky foot in front of the other,<br/>
      My aging body sore and stiff.<br/>
      I've considered acquiescence.<br/>
      Perhaps it's time for me to quit.<br/>
      <br/>
      I'm so focused on survival<br/>
      And never looking down<br/>
      That I've lost sight of all the beauty<br/>
      That is everywhere around.<br/>
      <br/>
      The mountains towering over me<br/>
      With white blankets on their peaks.<br/>
      The green and sparkling river<br/>
      Flowing swift and aimlessly.<br/>
      <br/>
      The flawless azure cloudless sky.<br/>
      Those dark moments when she weeps.<br/>
      Her stars that shine so bright at night<br/>
      To safely guide my weary feet.<br/>
      <br/>
      Eagles soaring to their nests.<br/>
      The distant valleys deep and green.<br/>
      All of nature's busy creatures<br/>
      Who roam this earth so free.<br/>
      <br/>
      Those people who keep watch for me<br/>
      To catch me if I lose my balance.<br/>
      Who have staggered on their own tightropes<br/>
      So are well acquainted with the challenge.<br/>
      <br/>
      They keep vigil from a distance<br/>
      And have done their best to understand<br/>
      That I need to make this trek alone<br/>
      To become everything I am.<br/>
      <br/>
      The days and nights are passing now.<br/>
      My body's weak, but my will is strong.<br/>
      I stop and rest more frequently,<br/>
      But I recover and move on.<br/>
      <br/>
      I've been meandering this tightrope now<br/>
      For more than half my life,<br/>
      Surviving good and bad days too,<br/>
      But never giving up the fight.<br/>
      <br/>
      And those who really love me<br/>
      Who have never lost their faith,<br/>
      Have helped convince me through it all<br/>
      This was a journey I could make.<br/>
      <br/>
      So to all of you who are like me,<br/>
      Walking that fine and tottering line,<br/>
      Just put one foot before the other,<br/>
      And you'll master it in time   <br/>
